                    Have I been developing this strength mentioned above in the last 3- 5 years?
                    I sit here wondering if I have been doing that. After deep consideration,
                    I realized that yes I have been somewhat developing my honesty. I believe
                    honesty is the best policy.

                    I strongly believe I have been developing this strenght in the
                    last 3-f years. I am always eager to read, sleep and eat- my loves
                    and joys.

                    My friend said this was a strength due to my cleaning tendencies.
                    I hate cleaning but if something I don't like is seen it's the fastest
                    you see me grab a broom. This has been in development in the last 3-5
                    years since I been living alone.

                    I feel this is 1 strenght that has been srongly developed in these
                    3-5 years. Why I say this, you may ask? University is my answer!
                    There are many times I wanted to drop up but i have stayed strong until
                    this moment and I will continue until I finally succeed.

                what I have read is by adhering to the discipline and spending each day wisely.
                Many person say that there are not many hours in a day and I sometimes
                agree with that saying as well. I believe we might say that because we spend our
                time doing things that does not make us happy or things that are not important
                to us, but we do them because it is something we must do.</td>

                Above is the third message gained from the book. The third way in which I could apply
                what I have read is to learn that the persons we associate ourselves with directly
                and indirectly influence us in ways we have never noticed before. Instead, we see those things
                as a norm and a part of us but someone from the outside sees what we do not see. I can apply this to my
                life by revising the persons I associate myself with and deciding which category I would place them such
                as mentioned in the book- no association, slight association, and association. It is important
                to associate oneself with persons who have ambition and has a direction in which their life is heading
                or associate oneself with successful persons.</td>

                Above is the fourth message gained from the book. The fourth way in which I could apply
                what I have read is through self-education- it would make you a fortune.
                Therefore, reading a book a day is likely to bring better value than not reading a book.
                There is a saying that reading opens the window to a different world. I can say out of the 4 chapters,
                the only one I have been doing all this time is the last one- reading.</td>
