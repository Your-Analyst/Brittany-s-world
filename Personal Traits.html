                        I believe the test done in http://similarminds.com/ was valid in general and in my individual
                        case, I believe most of the results was quite accurate. The Motiv Test gave me the type AxHWDxS
                        (Ascetic, Haphazard, Withholding, Depressive and Sectarian). As for the Jung Test, I received
                        the ISTP type which displayed being hidden, private, has trouble describing feelings, not very
                        affectionate, loner tendencies, lower energy, can be insensitive to the misfortune of others
                        etc.
                        The personality disorder test varies with Paranoid, Schizoid, Antisocial and Avoidant being the
                        highest
                        of over 70%. These four disorders are mostly correct although for antisocial- I am 100% selfish
                        or
                        inconsiderate. I am more along the lines of caring for specific persons. The Enneagram test also
                        varies
                        with Type 4, Type 8 and Type 9 being the highest of 50 and over.
